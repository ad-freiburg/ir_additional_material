### Numpy broadcasting

Look into `broadcasting.py`. It contains
an explanation about how the numpy broadcasting
rules work.

Afterwards, run the examples:

```bash
# run the script
python broadcasting.py

# run the script, not only printing shapes,
# but also values of the vectors
python broadcasting.py -v
```

Feel free to play around with the script
or add additional examples.
